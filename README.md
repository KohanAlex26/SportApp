# SportApp

-I implemented an application in Java with backend and frontend.

-For the backend I used Spring and Angular for the frontend.

-To map models to database I used Hibernate.

-For the database I used PostgreSQL.

-I have multiple types of relations between entities: one to one, one to many and many to many.
